# Final-Year-Project

Every final year project becomes difficult for some people,it makes interesting for some people
For us it's might seem to be tricky..
Yes
From PPT submission for Review To Final project submission.


It's seems very tricky and very nervous
How would the project looks like?
How would we complete this project on time?
Is this model provide a accuracy?
So many questions on our mind
The only answer is to take first step forward.
We have attended three reviews, before our final university submission.
On the review itself we got a idea about our project submission.

Yes Here are details and documentation of our project.

Our project title : 

Development of therapy efficacy model for autism spectrum disorder
 
Project Abstract :

  Our project abstract is to predict the therapy for Autism  affected people based on their age group and variation in condition.Our project develops a 
Therapy Efficacy Model (TEM) using machine learning to predict the effectiveness of ASD interventions like ABA, Speech Therapy, and  Occupational Therapy 
based on patient features. Utilize ensemble learning (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) for  improved accuracy and feature importance analysis to identify key 
factors influencing therapy outcomes.Implement explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME, LRP) to enhance transparency and trust in therapy recommendations for 
healthcare professionals and caregivers.


Existing & Proposed System :
 
The current landscape of therapy efficacy assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) predominantly relies on subjective assessment, clinical judgment, and standardized behavioral assessment tools. We have created the model named Therapy efficacy model (TEM). 

 The TEM combines behavioral assessments, therapy response history, cognitive function data, and socio-environmental factors for a holistic therapy evaluation.
     
 We utilize LSTM networks, attention mechanisms, autoencoders, and ensemble learning for therapy effectiveness prediction.
     
Algorithm : 

1. Machine Learning Algorithms:
 
 Random Forest Classifier (For ensemble learning and feature importance)
 XGBoost Classifier (For boosting and high prediction precision)
 Support Vector Machine (SVM) (For classification and decision boundaries)

 2. Preprocessing Algorithms:
 
 StandardScaler (For standardizing numerical data)
 LabelEncoder (For encoding categorical data into numerical labels)
 Mean/Median Imputation (For handling missing values)
 
 3. Evaluation Algorithms:

 Accuracy (Measures overall correctness)
 Precision (Measures the proportion of true positive predictions)
 Recall (Measures the proportion of actual positives identified)
 F1-Score (Balances precision and recall)
 Confusion Matrix (Visualizes prediction performance)
 
 4.Explainable AI (XAI) Algorithms:

SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) (For feature importance and individual predictions)
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) 
(For local interpretability)
 
 5. Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib (For creating bar charts and line plots)
Seaborn (For advanced statistical visualizations)
 
 6.Data Splitting:

Train-Test Split (Splitting data into training and testing sets)
Cross-Validation (K-Fold) (Ensuring robust model performance through multiple splits)


Future Enhancements : 

1.Incorporation of Additional Therapies:
Extend the model to include therapies like music therapy, 
social skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) for a broader range of treatment predictions.

2.Real-Time Data Integration:
 Enable real-time data collection from wearable devices and 
sensors to monitor patient progress continuously.

3.Enhanced Time-Series Analysis:
 Improve longitudinal analysis using advanced algorithms 
like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for better 
prediction of long-term therapy outcomes.

4.Adaptive Learning Mechanism:
 Develop an adaptive system that updates its predictions as 
new patient data becomes available, ensuring dynamic and 
personalized recommendations.

5.Expansion of Dataset:
 Increase the dataset size by collaborating with more clinical
 sites, improving model generalizability across diverse 
populations.


Conclusion : 

  The Therapy Efficacy Model (TEM) developed using ensemble machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM effectively predicts the 
outcomes of therapies like ABA, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). With an accuracy of 89.3%,
the model identifies key factors such as early intervention age, therapy intensity, and baseline severity score, aiding personalized treatment recommendations.
Its use of longitudinal analysis provides insights into therapy progression over time. By incorporating demographic and socioeconomic data, the model ensures 
broader applicability across diverse populations.
